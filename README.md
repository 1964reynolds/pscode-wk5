// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(start with 2 numbers 
+ the two numbers together
= sum)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(print "enter any number to check, even or odd"
read input of number
if number mod=
print "number is even'
else 
print "number is odd"
end)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(input n1,n2,n3,n4,n5
avg=(n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
small =n1
large =n1
for i =2 to 5
if n1>ni then;
small=ni
if n1 <ni; 
then large=ni
print ("average" ,avg)
print ("smallest;" small)
print (â€œlargest", large))
